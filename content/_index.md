# shift's website, the sequel.

## Overview

We're updating the content and creating a new website to share the content from http://shift2bikes.org

This repository has a hugo site to help navigate this content, but all content is stored as markdown and should be usable with minimal modifications in another modern site framework.

## Existing content scraped with minimal editing

We're looking to edit this before going live with it, but you can find the existing ported content in [the "Existing" category](/existing)

## TODO

### Need to port 

This is a first-pass listing of existing content that we'd like to save

- pedalpalooza posters
- history
- bike racks

### Need to create content 
- what is pedalpalooza and how to pedalpalooze
- associated organizations and groups
  - Street Trust, puddlecycle, shift calendar devs, TNR/Portland Urban bike, dropouts, MCBF, WNBR, umbrella, canvas dreams, etc.
- how to participate
  - how to lead a ride
  - ride ridership guide
  - volunteerism for shift
- Contacts
  - facebook, twitter, listserv
