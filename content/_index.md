# shift's website, the sequel.

### Overview

We're updating the content and creating a new website to share the content from http://shift2bikes.org

This repository has a hugo site to help navigate this content, but all content is stored as markdown and should be usable with minimal modifications in another modern site framework.

### Existing content scraped with minimal editing

You can find the existing ported content in [the "Existing" category](/existing)

We're looking to edit this before going live with it.

### TODO


#### Need to port from existing website still

- history (biz meeting notes, images, ride reports, etc)
- xmas carols + stickers + logos
- ride leadership primer + cartoon

#### Needs review
- rest of the "stuff" on the shift website
- wnbr stuff?
- safety?
- visitor info?
- education page?
- get lit (probably ok to go away)

#### Need to create content 

What else is missing?
