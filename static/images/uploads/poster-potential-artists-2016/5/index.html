<h1>Manda Borealis</h1>
Hello - I'm Manda Borealis. I draw, hand-letter, illustrate, design and I just so happen to really enjoy riding my bike. I'm pretty darn excited for the chance to send you my art for consideration. 
<p>
I've lived in Portland for eleven years and have enjoyed countless rides. Last year's summer equinox ride was by far my favorite so far. I have a soft spot for night rides, and the route we went on took us through many of my favorite spots around the city. I didn't get to the end of the ride, however, because my friend's tire popped and we were stranded on the outskirts of SE kind of in between OMSI and the esplanade. A cyclist from the ride stopped to help and after my friend realized he couldn't patch his tire, our new friend, Aaron gave us a new bike tube. His spirit and generosity was kind and friendly - he didn't have to stick behind and help us or even give us his extra tube, but he did and even with a patient smile. Unfortunately, we were unable to fix the tire and we said good-bye to Aaron so he could catch the end of the ride. We caught the last bus of the night, loaded our bikes on the bus rack and the whole ride back to town was spent gushing about how much fun the night had been. That night showcased every single element of the spirit of Pedalpalooza - bikes, fun, Portland's great parks & views, beer, music, dancing, fellowship and camaraderie. I get so much out of those memories -- having the opportunity to give back and glorify those experiences through art would be so rewarding! 
<p>
I want you to know that I'd tackle the hell out of this project with so much excitement and gusto. I have over a decade of professional design and illustration experience. I've worked as a pre-press technician, so I'm schooled on how to create print-ready art. I have worked in small design groups and large teams, learning first hand just how important and valuable constructive criticism can be. I do web design as well, so no problem on creating web art AND I have a degree in 3D animation, so no sweat on animated gifs! I love the DIY approach of Pedalpalooza and am committed to put a hefty effort into showcasing all of that into one rad idea.
<p>
My idea of the ultimate Pedalpalooza ride would be a sunset night ride light-up dance party. We'd start downtown wind through Portland ending at Sandy River Delta Park for an epic dance party. Bonfire, loud dance music... oh and involving doughnuts somewhere would be a bonus.
