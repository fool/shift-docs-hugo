<h1>Drew Anderson</h1>
My approach for this poster would be to team up with my friend Kelly Fry and we would collaborate on the poster together. I want to create a poster that people will see and want to own. We are a pretty awesome team and we both decided we would like to work together on this project if one of us was selected.

Iâ€™m a visual artist, humorist, designer, maker and creator. My background is in the arts and I even ran a small gallery in Portland.

I would like pedalpalooza ride that would be a photo scavenger hunt that encourages participants (strangers) to work together to complete the items on the list.
