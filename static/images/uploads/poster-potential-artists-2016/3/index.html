<h1>Janet Lackey</h1>

Hi! my name is Janet Lackey, submitting myself for consideration as an artist for Pedalpalooza. I'm a longtime Pedalpalooza fan (it's the event that got me over my fear to ride my bike in the city).
<p>
I've attached 5 pieces of work. I've been working as a graphic designer since 2005, a job that has led me to develop a versatility in design styles. I envision a design with bold colors, geometry, quirky. Much of my work is vector-based illustration but recently have been doing some more illustrative brush work which could be a softer approach.
<p>
Ultimate Pedalpalooza ride idea... well I think it's technically been done but my idea is a Bicycle Photobooth Pub Crawl. I actually created my own version of this just for my friends for a few years in a row but haven't braved leading it for the official Pedalpalooza event yet. Somebody else did! My other idea would be a Skeeball crawl.
