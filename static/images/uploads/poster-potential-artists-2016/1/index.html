<h1>Carla Bartow</h1>
My name is Carla Bartow and I love bikes and poster design oh, so much.  I'd love to create a fun, imaginative bike world for this poster featuring magical bikes in a non-traditional place (underwater or in space!).  I love doing hand-carved type, which would be a part of it as well.  I have experience in doing poster design for Tweed Rides, record labels (Ani DiFranco), Film Festivals, Aerial Circuses, The Fillmore West, different culinary and wine events, and many more.  I have direct experience with the bicycle industry as well, having recently won the 2015 Nutcase Helmets Artist's series, where I created art for a helmet and traveled to Eurobike and Interbike, creating murals with the project.  I also created the cover art for the Interbike guide this year.<p>

The ultimate Pedalpalooza ride would involve costumes, new places that I haven't seen on my bike, music, all different kinds of bikes, and an end party at a special location on the water with snacks, new friends, and dancing.<p>
