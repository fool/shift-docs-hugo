<h1>Kelly Fry</h1>
Thanks for taking the time to review my attached images and hear about my idea. If given the opportunity to work on this rad poster I'd depict a brightly colored bike of unusual proportions. Hanging from the bike will be an assortment of people, animals and plants of all shapes and sizes riding the magical bike into Portland. 
<p>
I have prior experience making poster designs for the Portland Film Festival. I've also done freelance work on independent films, video games, and comic book projects. My attached images include my love for paper cut-outs, examples of zines and other materials I've made,and a small sample of my daily doodles (an art practice I'd been doing daily for the past 8 months). 
<p>
My ultimate Pedalpalooza ride would be biking to each dog park in Portland, to accompany the dog parade (which will simultaneously be happening).
