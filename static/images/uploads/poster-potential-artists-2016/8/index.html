<h1>Laura Andrews</h1>
I was very excited to see that applications are being accepted to create this year's Pedalpalooza poster art. I've been participating in the cycling celebrations y'all have worked so hard to make happen for almost ten years now, and I would love the chance to express what Pedalpalooza and the bike fun movement of Portland has meant to me. I'm an avid cyclist, Zoobomber, bike event organizer, and I've created lots of art over the years to help promote the events I'm involved in (see my attachments!). I create unique fonts and drawings by hand, and I have a very clear idea of how I would approach this project. I'd like to illustrate perhaps a dozen small examples of  the diverse ways in which people celebrate Pedalpalooza, showcasing freak bikers, commuters, adventure enthusiasts and more, and incorporate those with playful, illuminated text detailing the events.

I have a vision of my perfect Pedalpalooza ride- It's called the Womp Womp Swamp Romp, and it's a family friendly, easy pace day ride that features a creative route through some lesser known urban areas, fun bike challenges, and lots and lots of mud.
