<h1>Chamisa Kellogg</h1>

I'm a Portland-based illustrator, graphic designer and cyclist, and I'd love to be considered for the 2016 Pedalpalooza poster. I'm attaching some of my related work, as well as a description below of how I would approach this project.
<p>
I've created many illustrations, layouts, and designs for clients in the past, both for print and web. I work full-time as a creative, I value the collaborative process of design, and take feedback to heart. I'm looking to expand my portfolio of posters, and this would be a fantastic opportunity for me and I think my work would lend itself well to the subject matter.
<p>
My ultimate Pedalpalooza ride includes a bike which I have engineered to heat my coffee as I ride, while simultaneously powering the cooler that contains my beer, water and other refreshingly chilly snacks.
