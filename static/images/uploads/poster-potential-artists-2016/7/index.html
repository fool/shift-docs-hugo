<h1>Seamus Burke</h1>

I've worked as a professional cartoonist, illustrator, and graphic designer in Portland since 2012. I've been associated with the Community Cycling Center, the Independent Publishing Resource Center, Creative Partners Curriculum, Devi Ever FX, the People's Art of Portland, and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. 
<p>
Attached are freelance works I've done for various local companies, groups, or work I've done on my own.

I can describe my perfect Pedalpalooza ride in three words: unique and fun. My work is all about identity. You can have it both ways, something that appeals to many but still has care and thought put into it, and calls everyone to join. Why make a mediocre product or event no one can relate to or only a few respond to, when you can do something special that people respond to? Why preach to the choir when you can invigorate the pews?
